rarbg
Backup of magnets from RARBG

everything.7z holds everything that i compiled (3,468,029)
xrmb.7z holds all of xrmb's rarbg magnets (2,843,291)
sorted holds nicely categorized and useful magnets for shows and movies

Some of the stuff in everything.7z did not come from RARBG, but I just left it all. Xrmb's database is all from RARBG.
